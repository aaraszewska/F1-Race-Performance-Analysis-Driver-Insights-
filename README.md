# F1 Race Performance Analysis & Driver Insights 
1️⃣ Data Collection & Storage
🔹 APIs & Web Scraping:

Ergast API (F1 historical race data)

OpenF1 API (Real-time and historical telemetry)

BeautifulSoup / Selenium (Scraping additional data from F1 websites like formula1.com)

🔹 Database & Storage:

PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server (Relational database for structured F1 data)

MongoDB (If storing unstructured data like race telemetry)

Google BigQuery (For scalable cloud-based storage)

2️⃣ Data Processing & Analysis
🔹 Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, SciPy)

Cleaning, transforming, and analyzing race performance data

Handling missing values, feature engineering, and data merging

🔹 SQL

Writing queries for analyzing lap times, pit stops, and driver rankings

3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Visualization
🔹 Matplotlib & Seaborn (Basic visualizations)
🔹 Plotly & Dash (Interactive race trends, driver comparisons)
🔹 Tableau / Power BI (For creating dashboards with insights like lap time trends and pit stop strategies)

4️⃣ Machine Learning (If doing prediction)
🔹 Scikit-Learn & XGBoost (Regression & classification models)

Predict driver performance based on past races

Predict lap times & pit stop efficiency

🔹 Time Series Models (ARIMA, LSTM, Prophet)

Forecasting future lap times and race performance

🔹 OpenCV & Computer Vision (Optional)

Analyzing race footage for advanced insights

5️⃣ Deployment & Sharing Insights
🔹 Streamlit / Flask / FastAPI

Build an interactive web app to showcase driver statistics and race trends

🔹 Tableau 

Dashboarding race results, driver insights, and lap time analysis
