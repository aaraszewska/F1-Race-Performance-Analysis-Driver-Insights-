# F1 Race Performance Analysis & Driver Insights 

# Phase 1: Data Collection
Primary Data Sources:

Ergast API (historical race data, lap times, driver standings)

OpenF1 API (real-time telemetry, driver stats, race results)

Formula 1 Website: For additional stats and current race results (scraping with BeautifulSoup/Selenium)

Other Sources: Driver performance data, team strategy details from sports websites and databases.

# Phase 2: Data Processing & Cleaning
Data Extraction & Storage

Extract data from APIs using Python’s requests module.

Store the data in a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL or MySQL).

Use SQL to structure the data and allow easy querying.

# Data Cleaning (Using Pandas)

Handle missing values (drop or impute).

Clean categorical variables (team names, race locations).

Convert data types for numerical analysis (e.g., lap times, pit stop times).

Merge race data with driver/team performance data.

# Feature Engineering

Create new columns, such as average lap time, pit stop count, and race position by driver.

Calculate metrics like fastest lap, pit stop efficiency, driver consistency.

# Phase 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
# Visualizing Race Trends

Lap Time Distribution: Plot histograms and box plots of lap times across different races.

Pit Stop Analysis: Analyze the number of pit stops, pit stop duration, and their impact on race performance.

Driver Performance Comparison: Use scatter plots and line charts to compare driver performance (e.g., fastest lap times).

# Insights and Trends

Identify performance patterns, such as whether a driver’s performance improves or worsens over time.

Analyze how different teams perform under different weather conditions or track types.

Advanced Visualizations (Plotly for Interactivity)

Create interactive visualizations of race data and driver comparisons.

Visualize driver rankings, fastest laps, and performance over time.

# Phase 4: Predictive Modeling (Optional)
Race Outcome Prediction

Use Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost to predict race outcomes (e.g., who will finish in the top 3).

Predict the performance of drivers based on historical data (e.g., predicting lap time for a given driver based on track conditions).

Time Series Forecasting (for predicting race results or driver performance trends)

ARIMA or Prophet models to forecast future race results based on historical performance.

LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models for predicting time series of lap times.

# Phase 5: Dashboarding & Reporting
Create Dashboards

Tableau: Build dashboards to showcase key performance metrics (e.g., lap times, pit stop efficiency, race predictions).



# Metrics to Include in Dashboards

Driver Insights: Performance metrics like fastest laps, average lap times, total race time, number of pit stops.

Race Insights: Pit stop strategy efficiency, track conditions, weather impact.

Predictions: Visualize model predictions for race outcomes and driver performance.

# Phase 6: Deployment (Optional)
Deploying Models

FastAPI: Create a simple web service to serve your predictive models and provide race predictions to users.

Streamlit: Build an interactive web application for users to explore your analysis and predictions.

Interactive Web App

Allow users to explore driver statistics, race results, and performance forecasts.

Provide real-time data updates during live races.
